* MME Mobility-Management Entity
  - Track UE's via tracking area
  - Call processing

** Functions
*** Network access control functions  
    Network access is the means by which a user is connected to the evolved packet core system
**** Network/Access network selection  
     UE selects a PLMN/Access network from which to gain IP connectivity
**** Authentication and authorisation function  
     - ref. MMF
**** Admission control function  
**** Policy and Charging Enforcement Function  
     - PCEF as defined by TS 23.203
**** Lawful Interception  
*** Packet routing and transfer functions  
    The EPS is an IP network and uses the standard routing and transport mechanisms of the underlying IP network. 
**** IP header compression function       
**** Packet screening function  
*** Security functions      
**** Ciphering function  
**** Integrity protection function  
*** Mobility management functions  
    The mobility management functions are used to keep track of the current location of a UE
**** Reachability Management for UE in ECM-IDLE state  
     An EMM-REGISTERED UE performs periodic Tracking Area Updates with
     the network after the expiry of the periodic TAU timer
**** Tracking Area list management  
**** Inter-eNodeB mobility anchor function  
**** Inter-GPP mobility anchor function  
**** Idle mode signalling reduction function  
**** Mobility Restrictions 
**** IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication  
*** Radio Resource Management functions  
    Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority, RFSP Index value to the
    eNB across S1. The S1 messages that transfer the RFSP Index to the
    eNodeB are specified in TS 36.413
*** Network management functions  
**** Load balancing between MMEs  
**** Load re-balancing between MMEs  
**** MME control of overload  
*** Selection functions  
**** PDN GW selection function (GPP accesses)  
**** Serving GW selection function  
**** MME selection function  
**** SGSN selection function  
**** Selection of PCRF  
*** IP network related functions  
**** Domain Name Service function  
**** DHCP function

** Modules
*** EMM (Evolved Mobility Management)
    - Talk to S-GW to select P-GW for UE
*** ESM (Evolved Session Management)
    - RRC
