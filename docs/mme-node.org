** EPS bearers

*** UL Traffic Flow Aggregates 
    An UpLink Traffic Flow Template (UL TFT) is the set of uplink  packet filters in a TFT.

    UE:     UL-TFT -> RB-ID
    eNodeB: RB-ID -> S1-TEID 
    S-GW S1 Bearer: S1-TEID S5/S8-TEID 
     
*** DL Traffic Flow Aggregates 
    A DownLink Traffic Flow Template (DL TFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT
    P-GW S5/S8 Bearer: DL-TFT -> S5/S8-TEID 

* MME Mobility-Management Entity
  - Track UE's via tracking area
  - Call processing

** Entity

*** EPS bearer identity
    TI usage is defined in TS 23.060
*** Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity 
    The MME shall allocate a Globally Unique Temporary Identity (GUTI)
    to the UE. The GUTI is defined in TS 23.003
*** Tracking Area Identity (TAI)
    The Tracking Area Identity is constructed from the MCC (Mobile
    Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code) and TAC (Tracking Area
    Code).
*** eNodeB S1-AP UE Identity (eNB S1-AP UE ID) 
    It is unique within the eNodeB.

*** MME S1-AP UE Identity (MME S1-AP UE ID) 
    It is unique within the MME.

** Procedures
*** Attach procedure

*** Tracking Area Update procedures

*** Service Request procedures

*** S1 release procedure

*** GUTI Reallocation procedure

*** Detach procedure

*** HSS User Profile management function procedure

*** Security Function
*** UE Reachability procedures
*** Handover
    The handover preparation and execution phases are performed as specified in TS 36.300
**** X2-based handover
**** S1-based handover
** Functions
*** Network access control functions  
    Network access is the means by which a user is connected to the evolved packet core system
**** Network/Access network selection  
     UE selects a PLMN/Access network from which to gain IP connectivity
**** Authentication and authorisation function  
     - ref. MMF
**** Admission control function  
**** Policy and Charging Enforcement Function  
     - PCEF as defined by TS 23.203
**** Lawful Interception  
*** Packet routing and transfer functions  
    The EPS is an IP network and uses the standard routing and
    transport mechanisms of the underlying IP network.

**** IP header compression function       
**** Packet screening function

*** Security functions      
**** Ciphering function  
**** Integrity protection function  
*** Mobility management functions  
    The mobility management functions are used to keep track of the current location of a UE
**** Reachability Management for UE in ECM-IDLE state  
     An EMM-REGISTERED UE performs periodic Tracking Area Updates with
     the network after the expiry of the periodic TAU timer
**** Tracking Area list management  
**** Inter-eNodeB mobility anchor function  
**** Inter-GPP mobility anchor function  
**** Idle mode signalling reduction function  
**** Mobility Restrictions 
**** IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication  
*** Radio Resource Management functions  
    Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority, RFSP Index value to the
    eNB across S1. The S1 messages that transfer the RFSP Index to the
    eNodeB are specified in TS 36.413
*** Network management functions  
**** Load balancing between MMEs  
**** Load re-balancing between MMEs  
**** MME control of overload  
*** Selection functions  
**** PDN GW selection function (GPP accesses)  
**** Serving GW selection function  
**** MME selection function  
**** SGSN selection function  
**** Selection of PCRF  
*** IP network related functions  
**** Domain Name Service function  
**** DHCP function
     IPv4 address allocation via default bearer activation, if IPv4 is supported. 

** Modules
*** MME
*** EMM (Evolved Mobility Management)
    - Talk to S-GW to select P-GW for UE
*** ESM (Evolved Session Management)
    - RRC
*** RRC
    The NAS protocol supports mobility management functionality and
    user plane bearer activation, modification and deactivation. It is
    also responsible of ciphering and integrity protection of NAS
    signalling.
