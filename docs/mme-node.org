** UE Capability Handling 
   The UE Capability information is made up of the UE Radio Capability
   information and the UE Core Network Capability information
*** UE Radio Capability Handling 
   - MME stores the UE Capability information during ECM-IDLE state
   - send its most up to date UE Radio Capability information to the
     E-UTRAN in the S1 interface INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message
     unless the UE is performing an Attach procedure or a Tracking
     Area Update procedure
*** UE Core Network Capability
    - UE Network Capability IE (mostly for E-UTRAN access related core network parameters)
    - Network Capability IE (mostly for UTRAN/GERAN access related core network parameters)
*** UE Specific DRX Parameter handling 
    - Details are specified in TS 36.304
** Warning message delivery procedure
** Configuration Transfer procedure / RAN Information Management (RIM)
   - exchange the eNodeBs IP addresses in order to be able to use X2
     interface between the eNodeBs for Self-Optimizeed Networks (SON),
     as specified in TS 36.413
   - The source RAN node sends a message to its MME including the
     source and destination addresses. The MME uses the destination
     address to route the message encapsulated in a GTP message to the
     correct MME via the S10 interface (see TS 29.274)
