** EPS bearers

*** UL Traffic Flow Aggregates 
    An UpLink Traffic Flow Template (UL TFT) is the set of uplink  packet filters in a TFT.

    UE:     UL-TFT -> RB-ID
    eNodeB: RB-ID -> S1-TEID 
    S-GW S1 Bearer: S1-TEID S5/S8-TEID 
     
*** DL Traffic Flow Aggregates 
    A DownLink Traffic Flow Template (DL TFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT
    P-GW S5/S8 Bearer: DL-TFT -> S5/S8-TEID 

* MME Mobility-Management Entity
  - Track UE's via tracking area
  - Call processing

** Entity

*** EPS bearer identity
    TI usage is defined in TS 23.060
*** Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity 
    The MME shall allocate a Globally Unique Temporary Identity (GUTI)
    to the UE. The GUTI is defined in TS 23.003
*** Tracking Area Identity (TAI)
    The Tracking Area Identity is constructed from the MCC (Mobile
    Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code) and TAC (Tracking Area
    Code).
*** eNodeB S1-AP UE Identity (eNB S1-AP UE ID) 
    It is unique within the eNodeB.

*** MME S1-AP UE Identity (MME S1-AP UE ID) 
    It is unique within the MME.

** Procedures

*** Attach procedure

*** Tracking Area Update procedures

*** Service Request procedures

*** S1 release procedure

*** GUTI Reallocation procedure

*** Detach procedure

*** HSS User Profile management function procedure

*** Security Function
*** UE Reachability procedures
*** Handover
    The handover preparation and execution phases are performed as specified in TS 36.300
**** X2-based handover
**** S1-based handover
** Functions
*** Network access control functions  
    Network access is the means by which a user is connected to the evolved packet core system
**** Network/Access network selection  
     UE selects a PLMN/Access network from which to gain IP connectivity
**** Authentication and authorisation function  
     - ref. MMF
**** Admission control function  
**** Policy and Charging Enforcement Function  
     - PCEF as defined by TS 23.203
**** Lawful Interception  
*** Packet routing and transfer functions  
    The EPS is an IP network and uses the standard routing and
    transport mechanisms of the underlying IP network.

**** IP header compression function       
**** Packet screening function

*** Security functions      
**** Ciphering function  
**** Integrity protection function  
*** Mobility management functions  
    The mobility management functions are used to keep track of the current location of a UE
**** Reachability Management for UE in ECM-IDLE state  
     An EMM-REGISTERED UE performs periodic Tracking Area Updates with
     the network after the expiry of the periodic TAU timer
**** Tracking Area list management  
**** Inter-eNodeB mobility anchor function  
**** Inter-GPP mobility anchor function  
**** Idle mode signalling reduction function  
**** Mobility Restrictions 
**** IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication  
*** Radio Resource Management functions  
    Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority, RFSP Index value to the
    eNB across S1. The S1 messages that transfer the RFSP Index to the
    eNodeB are specified in TS 36.413
*** Network management functions  
**** Load balancing between MMEs  
**** Load re-balancing between MMEs  
**** MME control of overload  
*** Selection functions  
**** PDN GW selection function (GPP accesses)  
**** Serving GW selection function  
**** MME selection function  
**** SGSN selection function  
**** Selection of PCRF  
*** IP network related functions  
**** Domain Name Service function  
**** DHCP function
     IPv4 address allocation via default bearer activation, if IPv4 is supported. 

** Modules
*** MME
*** EMM (Evolved Mobility Management)
    - Talk to S-GW to select P-GW for UE
*** ESM (Evolved Session Management)
    - RRC
*** RRC
    The NAS protocol supports mobility management functionality and
    user plane bearer activation, modification and deactivation. It is
    also responsible of ciphering and integrity protection of NAS
    signalling.
* HSS Home Subscriber Server
** Subscriber Database
   - Last Located MME
   - Authentication 
   - Authorising policy

* S-Gw Serving Gataway
  - Anchor the user
  - Act ass MiddleMan for signaling between P-GW and MME
  - Handle IP packets between P-GW and eNodeB
  - IP router with support of GTP (eNodeB and P-GW)
  - Charging
  - Rouming S8/S5

* P-GW PDN Gateaway
  - Anchor PDN
  - Policy Control Enforcement Function
    - QOS controll (talk to PCRF)
  - IP router for GTP and Diameter
  - In order to support DHCP based IP address configuration, the PDN
    GW shall act as the DHCP server for HPLMN assigned dynamic and
    static

* UE

** UE Capability Handling 
   The UE Capability information is made up of the UE Radio Capability
   information and the UE Core Network Capability information
*** UE Radio Capability Handling 
   - MME stores the UE Capability information during ECM-IDLE state
   - send its most up to date UE Radio Capability information to the
     E-UTRAN in the S1 interface INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message
     unless the UE is performing an Attach procedure or a Tracking
     Area Update procedure
*** UE Core Network Capability
    - UE Network Capability IE (mostly for E-UTRAN access related core network parameters)
    - Network Capability IE (mostly for UTRAN/GERAN access related core network parameters)
*** UE Specific DRX Parameter handling 
    - Details are specified in TS 36.304
** Warning message delivery procedure
** Configuration Transfer procedure / RAN Information Management (RIM)
   - exchange the eNodeBs IP addresses in order to be able to use X2
     interface between the eNodeBs for Self-Optimizeed Networks (SON),
     as specified in TS 36.413
   - The source RAN node sends a message to its MME including the
     source and destination addresses. The MME uses the destination
     address to route the message encapsulated in a GTP message to the
     correct MME via the S10 interface (see TS 29.274)

* PDN
* Out of scope

** MBMS
** Charging
** Multiple-PDN support
